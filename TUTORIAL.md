# Tutorial for template creation

A template defines which data attributes you wish to retrieve from an
invoice. Each template should work on all invoices of a company or
subsidiary (e.g. Amazon Germany vs Amazon US).

Adding templates is easy and shouldn't take longer than adding 2-3
invoices by hand. We use a simple YML-format. Many options are optional
and you just need them to take care of edge cases.

Existing templates can be found in the project folder or the installed
package under `/invoice2data/templates/`. During testing you can use the
`--template-folder` option to point to your own, new template files. If
you add or improve templates that could be useful for everyone, we
encourage you to file a pull request to the main repo, so everyone can
use it.

## Simple invoice template

Here is a sample of a minimal invoice template to read invoiced issued
by Microsoft Hong Kong:

    issuer: Microsoft Regional Sales Corporation
    keywords:
    - Microsoft
    - M9-0002526-N
    fields:
      amount: GrandTotal(\d+\.\d+)HKD
      date: DocumentDate:(\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4})
      invoice_number: InvoiceNo.:(\w+)
    options:
      remove_whitespace: true
      currency: HKD
      date_formats:
        - '%d/%m/%Y'

Let's look at each field:

- `issuer`: The name of the invoice issuer. Can have the company name and country.
- `keywords`: Also a required field. These are used to pick the
   correct template. Be as specific as possible. As we add more
   templates, we need to avoid duplicate matches. Using the VAT number,
   email, website, phone, etc are generally good choices. ALL keywords
   need to match to use the template.

### Fields

All the regex `fields` you need extracted. Required fields are `amount`,
`date`, `invoice_number`. It's up to you, if you need more fields
extracted. Each field can be defined as:

- an **associative array** with `parser` specifying parsing method
- a single regex with one capturing group
- an array of regexes

The first method is preferred. It was introduced to make templates
syntax cleaner and more flexible. It aims to replace old methods.

It's not required to put add the whole regex to the capturing group.
Often we use keywords and only capture part of the match (e.g. the
amount).

You will need to understand regular expressions to find the right
values. If you didn't need them in your life up until now (lucky you),
you can learn about them
[here](http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/regex.htm) or [test them
here](http://www.regexr.com/). We use [Python's regex
engine](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html). It won't matter for
the simple expressions we need, but sometimes there are subtle
differences when e.g. coming from Perl.

### Parser `regex`

It\'s the basic parser that allows parsing content using regexes. The
only required property is `regex` that has to contain one or multiple
(specified using array) regexes.

By default `regex` parser removes all duplicated matches. It results a
single value or an array (depending an amount of unique matches found).

Optional properties:

- `type` (if present must be one of: `int`, `float`, `date`) -results
  in parsing every matched value to a specified type
- `group` (if present must be `sum`) - results in grouping all matched
  values using specified method

Example for `regex`:

    fields:
      amount:
        parser: regex
        regex: Total:\s+(\d+\.\d+) EUR
        type: float
      date:
        parser: regex
        regex: Issued on:\s+(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})
        type: date
      advance:
        parser: regex
        regex:
          - Advance payment:\s+(\d+\.\d+)
          - Paid in advance:\s+(\d+\.\d+)
        type: float
        group: sum

### Parser `static`

This pseudo-parser sets field with a content of `value` field.

Example:

    fields:
      friendly_name:
        parser: static
        value: Amazon

### Parser `lines`

This parser allows parsing selected invoice section as a set of lines
sharing some pattern. Those can be e.g. invoice items (good or services)
or VAT rates.

It replaces `lines` plugin and should be preferred over it. It allows
reusing in multiple `fields`.

Example for `fields`:

    fields:
      lines:
        parser: lines
        start: Item\s+Discount\s+Price$
        end: \s+Total
        line: (?P<description>.+)\s+(?P<discount>\d+.\d+)\s+(?P<price>\d+\d+)

### Legacy regexes

For non-text fields, the name of the field is important:

- the name of the field for date fields should start with **date**
- the name of the field for float fields should start with **amount**

There are also special prefixes that you can add to your field name:

- **static\_**: it will return the defined value (no regular
  expression is executed)
- **sum\_**: combined with a list of several regexps, it will return
  the sum of the amounts caught by each regexp (instead of returning
  the amount caught by the first regexp that caught something)

Note that these special prefix for field names are removed when
returning the result.

Example with the *sum\_* prefix:

    fields:
      sum_amount_tax:
        - VAT\s+10%\s+(\d+,\d{2})
        - VAT\s+20%\s+(\d+,\d{2})

If the first regexp for VAT 10% catches 1.5 and the second regexp for
VAT 20% catches 4.0, the result will be {'amount\_tax': 5.50, 'date':
...} (the *sum\_* prefix is removed).


### Lines

The `lines` key allows you to parse invoice items. Mandatory are regexes
`start` and `end` to figure out where in the stream the item table is
located. Then the regex `line` is applied, and supposed to contain named
capture groups. The names of the capture groups will be the field names
for the parsed item. If we have an invoice that looks like

    some header text

    the address, etc.

      Item        Discount      Price

     1st item     0.0 %           42.00
     2nd item     10.0 %          37.80

                          Total   79.80

    A footer

your lines definition should look like

    lines:
        start: Item\s+Discount\s+Price$
        end: \s+Total
        line: (?P<description>.+)\s+(?P<discount>\d+.\d+)\s+(?P<price>\d+\d+)

Then if you want the parser to coerce the fields to numeric types (by
default, they are strings), you can add a `types` key below `lines`:

    types:
        discount: float
        price: float

The example above is very simplistic, most invoices at least potentially
can have multiple lines per invoice item. In order to parse this
correctly, you can also give a `first_line` and/or `last_line` regex.
For every line, the parser will check if `first_line` matches, if yes,
it's a new line. If not, it checks if `last_line` matches, if yes, the
current line is commited, if not, `line` regex is checked, and if this
one doesn't match either, this line is ignored. This implies that you
need to take care that the `first_line` regex is the most specific one,
and `line` the least specific.

### Tables

The `tables` plugin allows you to parse table-oriented fields that have
a row of column headers followed by a row of values on the next line.
The plugin requires a `start` and `end` regex to identify where the
table is located in the invoice. The `body` regex should contain named
capture groups that will be added to the fields output. The plugin will
attempt to match the `body` regex to the invoice content found between
the `start` and `end` regexes.

An example invoice that contains table-oriented data may look like:

    Guest Name: Sanjay                                                                      Date: 31/12/2017

    Hotel Details                                                   Check In            Check Out       Rooms
    OYO 4189 Resort Nanganallur,                                    31/12/2017          01/01/2018      1
    25,Vembuliamman Koil Street,, Pazhavanthangal, Chennai
                                                                        Booking ID              Payment Mode
                                                                        IBZY2087                Cash at Hotel

    DESCRIPTION                                             RATE                                    AMOUNT

    Room Charges                                            Rs 1939 x 1 Night x 1 Room              Rs 1939

    Grand Total                                                                                     Rs 1939

    Payment received by OYO                                 Paid through Cash At Hotel (Rs 1939)    Rs 1939

    Balance ( if any )                                                                              Rs 0

The hotel name, check in and check out dates, room count, booking ID,
and payment mode are all located on different lines from their column
headings. A template to capture these fields may look like:

    tables:
      - start: Hotel Details\s+Check In\s+Check Out\s+Rooms
        end: Booking ID
        body: (?P<hotel_details>[\S ]+),\s+(?P<date_check_in>\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4})\s+(?P<date_check_out>\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4})\s+(?P<amount_rooms>\d+)
      - start: Booking ID\s+Payment Mode
        end: DESCRIPTION
        body: (?P<booking_id>\w+)\s+(?P<payment_method>(?:\w+ ?)*)

The plugin supports multiple tables per invoice as seen in the example.

By default, all fields are parsed as strings. The `tables` plugin
supports the `amount` and `date` field naming conventions to convert
data types.

### Options

Everything under `options` is optional. We expect to add more options in
the future to handle edge cases we find. Currently the most important
options and their defaults are:

- `currency` (default = `EUR`): The currency code returned. Many
  people will want to change this.
- `decimal_separator` (default = `.`): German invoices use `,` as
  decimal separator. So here is your chance to change it.
- `remove_whitespace` (default = `False`): Ignore any spaces. Often
  makes regex easier to write. Also used quite often.
- `remove_accents` (default = `False`): Useful when in France. Saves
  you from putting accents in your regular expressions.
- `lowercase` (default = `False`): Similar to whitespace removal.
- `date_formats` (default = `[]`): We use dateparser/dateutil to
  'guess' the correct date format. Sometimes this doesn't work and you
  can set one or more additional date formats. These are passed
  directly to [dateparser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser).
- `languages` (default = \[\]): Also passed to `dateparser` to parse
  names of months.
- `replace` (default = `[]`): Additional search and replace before
  matching. Not needed usually.
- `required_fields`: By default the template should have regex for
  date, amount, invoice\_number and issuer. If you wish to extract
  different fields, you can supply a list here. The extraction will
  fail if not all fields are matched.

### Example of template using most options

    issuer: Free Mobile
    fields:
      amount: \spayer TTC\*\s+(\d+.\d{2})
      amount_untaxed: Total de la facture HT\s+(\d+.\d{2})
      date: Facture no \d+ du (\d+ .+ \d{4})
      invoice_number: Facture no (\d+)
      static_vat: FR25499247138
    keywords:
      - FR25499247138
      - Facture
    required_fields:
      - static_vat
      - invoice_number
    options:
      currency: EUR
      date_formats:
        - '%d %B %Y'
      languages:
        - fr
      decimal_separator: '.'
      replace:
        - ['e´ ', 'é']


## Steps to add new template

To add a new template, we recommend this workflow:

### 1. Copy existing template to new file

Find a template that is roughly similar to what you need and copy it to
a new file. It's good practice to use reverse domain notation. E.g.
`country.company.division.language.yml` or
`fr.mobile.enterprise.french.yml`. Language is not always needed.
Template folder are searched recursively for files ending in `.yml`.

### 2. Change invoice issuer

Just used in the output. Best to use the company name.

### 3. Set keyword

Look at the invoice and find the best identifying string. Tax number +
company name are good options. Remember, *all* keywords need to be found
for the template to be used.

Keywords are compared *after* processing the extracted text. So if you
use lowercase or remove-whitespace processing, adapt keywords
accordingly.

### 4. First test run

Now we're ready to see how far we are off. Run `invoice2data` with the
following debug command to see if your keywords match and how much work
is needed for dates, etc.

`invoice2data --template-folder tpl --debug invoice-XXX.pdf`

This test run shows you how the program will "see" the text in the
invoice. Parsing PDFs is sometimes a bit unpredictable. Also make sure
your template is used. You should already receive some data from static
fields or currencies.

### 5. Add regular expressions

Now you can use the debugging text to add regex fields for the
information you need. It's a good idea to copy parts of the text
directly from the debug output and then replace the dynamic parts with
regex. Keep in mind that some characters need escaping. To test, re-run
the above command.

-   `date` field: First capture the date. Then see if `dateparser`
    handles it correctly. If not, add your format or language under
    options.
-   `amount`: Capture the number *without* currency code. If you expect
    high amounts, replace the thousand separator. Currently we don't
    parse numbers via locals (TODO)

### 6. Done

Now you're ready to commit and push your template, so others get a
chance to use and improve it.
